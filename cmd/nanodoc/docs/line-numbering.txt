LINE NUMBERING MODES
====================

Nanodoc provides two distinct modes for adding line numbers to the output.

MODES
-----

1.  **Per-File Numbering (`-n`):**
    In this mode, line numbering restarts at `1` for each new file that is added to the bundle. This is useful when you want to see line counts relative to each individual file.

2.  **Global Numbering (`-N`):**
    In this mode, line numbering is continuous across all files in the bundle. It starts at `1` for the first line of the first file and increments sequentially until the very last line of the last file. This is useful for getting a total line count or for referencing lines in the final combined document.

EXAMPLE
-------

Given two files:

`file1.txt`:
    hello
    world

`file2.txt`:
    foo
    bar

### Per-File Numbering Output:

    1. File1

    1 | hello
    2 | world

    2. File2

    1 | foo
    2 | bar

### Global Numbering Output:

    1. File1

    1 | hello
    2 | world

    2. File2

    3 | foo
    4 | bar

OPTIONS
-------

-n, --line-numbers         Per-file numbering: Each file starts from 1
-N, --global-line-numbers  Global numbering: Continues across all files
