TABLE OF CONTENTS GENERATION
============================

Nanodoc can generate a Table of Contents (TOC) based on the content of the files being processed. The generation follows a specific set of rules to identify titles.

TITLE EXTRACTION RULES
----------------------

The primary method for identifying a title is by scanning for Markdown headings.

1.  **Markdown Headings (Primary Source):**
    Nanodoc looks for H1 and H2 level Markdown headings within your documents. These are lines that start with `#` or `##`. Each H1 or H2 heading found will become a separate entry in the TOC.

    Example:
        # My Document Title
        ## A Section Title

    Both of these lines would be extracted as TOC entries.

2.  **First Line Fallback (For Markdown Files):**
    If a file with a `.md` or `.markdown` extension contains NO H1 or H2 headings, nanodoc will use the first non-empty line of that file as its single TOC entry.

3.  **Other File Types:**
    Files without a `.md` or `.markdown` extension do not contribute to the TOC unless a title is explicitly defined for them through other means (which is not a feature of the current version).

OUTPUT FORMAT
-------------

The generated TOC lists each extracted title, followed by the base filename from which it was extracted.

Example Output:
    Table of Contents
    =================

    - My Document Title (my_document.md)
    - A Section Title (my_document.md)
    - Another File Title (another_file.txt)

OPTIONS
-------

--toc    Generate a table of contents based on file titles and markdown headings

The TOC will be placed at the beginning of the output and shows:
- File titles (using the same style as headers: nice, filename, or path)
- Starting line numbers when combined with line numbering

TIP: Combine with global line numbering for easier navigation:
nanodoc --toc -N file1.txt file2.txt
