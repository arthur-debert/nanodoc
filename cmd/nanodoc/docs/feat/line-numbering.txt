LINE NUMBERING MODES

Nanodoc provides two distinct modes for adding line numbers to the output using a single unified flag.


MODES

    1. Per-File Numbering:
       In this mode, line numbering restarts at 1 for each new file that is added to the bundle. This is useful when you want to see line counts relative to each individual file.

    2. Global Numbering:
       In this mode, line numbering is continuous across all files in the bundle. It starts at 1 for the first line of the first file and increments sequentially until the very last line of the last file. This is useful for getting a total line count or for referencing lines in the final combined document.


EXAMPLE

Given two files:

file1.txt:
    -- 
        hello
        world
    --

file2.txt:
    -- 
        foo
        bar
    --


Per-File Numbering Output:

    -- 
        1. File1

        1 | hello
        2 | world

        2. File2

        1 | foo
        2 | bar
    --


Global Numbering Output:

    -- 
        1. File1

        1 | hello
        2 | world

        2. File2

        3 | foo
        4 | bar
    --


OPTIONS

    -l, --linenum <mode>  Enable line numbering with specified mode:
                          • file   - Per-file numbering: Each file starts from 1
                          • global - Global numbering: Continues across all files
    
    Examples:
        nanodoc file1.txt file2.txt --linenum file      # Per-file numbering
        nanodoc file1.txt file2.txt --linenum global    # Global numbering
        nanodoc file1.txt file2.txt -l file             # Short form
