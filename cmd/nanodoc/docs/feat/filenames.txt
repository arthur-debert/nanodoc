FILE FILENAMES AND NUMBERING

Nanodoc can automatically generate filenames for each file included in a bundle. The appearance of these filenames is controlled by two main settings: the file style and the file numbering style.


FILE STYLES

There are three available file styles:

    1. filename: Displays the simple filename (e.g., my_document.txt).
    2. path: Displays the full resolved path to the file.
    3. nice (Default): This style attempts to create a clean, human-readable title from the filename. The process is:
        - If a Table of Contents is generated, the file's primary title from the TOC is used.
        - Otherwise, it takes the filename, removes the extension, and cleans it up:
            - Replaces underscores and hyphens with spaces.
            - Splits camelCase words (e.g., myDocument becomes my Document).
            - Converts the result to Title Case (e.g., My Document).


FILE NUMBERING STYLES

The file numbering style determines the marker placed before the filename title.

    1. numerical (Default): 1., 2., 3.
    2. alphabetical: a., b., c.
    3. roman: i., ii., iii.


EXAMPLE

Given a file named my_first_document.md, using the default nice filename style and numerical sequence would produce the following filename:

    -- 
        1. My First Document
    --


OPTIONS

    --filenames             Show filenames between concatenated files (default: true)
                           Use --filenames=false to hide filenames completely
    --file-numbering=TYPE   Set the file numbering style (numerical, alphabetical, roman)
                           Default: numerical
    --file-style=STYLE      Set the filename display style (nice [default], filename, path)


EXAMPLES

    -- 
        "File (file.txt)"       Default style (nice: titled with original in parentheses)
        "file.txt"              Filename style
        "/path/to/file.txt"     Path style (full path)
        "1. file.txt"           With numerical file numbering
        "a. File (file.txt)"    Combined alphabetical numbering with nice style
