How to address part(s) of files:

The line range syntax can be used in:
- Command-line arguments: `nanodoc file.txt:L10-20`
- Bundle files: listing files with ranges
- Live bundles: [[file:path/to/file.txt:L5-10]]

Single lines

    <filename>:L<line num> -> a specific line number from file name
    ex: readme.txt:L20 -> the 20th line of the file
    
    <filename>:L$<num> -> line counted from end ($1 is last line)
    ex: readme.txt:L$1 -> the last line of the file
    ex: readme.txt:L$5 -> from 5th-to-last line to end

Ranges:
    <filename>:L<start>-<end> -> a range from lines start to end
    ex: readme.txt:L20-24 -> lines 20 through 24 in readme.txt file
    
    Negative indices with $ notation:
    ex: readme.txt:L1-$1 -> full file (line 1 to last line)
    ex: readme.txt:L$10-$5 -> from 10th-to-last to 5th-to-last line
    ex: readme.txt:L10-$2 -> from line 10 to 2nd-to-last line

Multiples:
    Both lines and ranges can be commbined, by separating them with commas.
    In this case the L prefix is used in all of them.
    ex:
        readme.txt:L14,L23-38,L40
        this gets lines 14, lines 23 trough 38 and lines 40

Invalid Lines:
    If any line reference is not found we raised an error, even if other in the multiple are found
Repeated Lines:
    We will not check for multiple repeated lines, nor any ordering issues
