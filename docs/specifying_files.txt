Items to be included as passed as arguments to the command.
Three ways to tell nanodoc which files to include:

1. INDIVIDUAL FILES:
   nanodoc file1.txt file2.txt file3.md
   Processes exactly these files in the order provided.

2. DIRECTORIES:
      nanodoc docs/
   Finds and processes all .txt and .md files in the directory and subdirectories.
   Files processed in alphabetical order.

3. BUNDLE FILES:
   nanodoc my-bundle.txt
   Where my-bundle.txt lists file paths, one per line:
   chapter1.txt
   images/diagram.md
   /absolute/path/to/notes.txt

   NEW: Bundle files can also contain command-line options!
   
   Example bundle file with options:
   # My Project Bundle
   --toc
   --line-numbers
   --theme classic-dark
   --header-style filename
   --sequence roman
   
   # Files to include
   chapter1.txt
   images/diagram.md
   /absolute/path/to/notes.txt
   
   Options in bundle files are applied as defaults. Command-line options
   override bundle options when explicitly specified.
   
   Supported options in bundle files:
   - --toc                     Generate table of contents
   - --line-numbers / -n       Enable per-file line numbering
   - --global-line-numbers / -N  Enable global line numbering
   - --theme THEME            Set theme (classic, classic-dark, classic-light)
   - --header-style STYLE     Set header style (nice, filename, path)
   - --sequence STYLE         Set sequence style (numerical, letter, roman)
   - --no-header              Suppress file headers
   - --txt-ext EXT            Additional file extensions to process

4. LIVE BUNDLE FILES:
   nanodoc live-bundle.txt
   Where live-bundle.txt can mix text and file paths:

   Introduction to the document
   chapter1.txt
   This text appears between chapters
   chapter2.txt
   Conclusion

   In live bundles, file paths are replaced with their content inline.
   No file titles or line number resets occur at file boundaries.
   This allows for seamless integration of content from multiple files.

   Example:
   If chapter1.txt contains "This is chapter 1 content" and
   chapter2.txt contains "This is chapter 2 content", the result will be:

   Introduction to the document
   This is chapter 1 content
   This text appears between chapters
   This is chapter 2 content
   Conclusion

   Live bundles also support inline file inclusion using the [[file:path]] syntax:

   This paragraph includes [[file:quote.txt]] right in the middle of the text.

   With this syntax, the file content is inserted inline with all line breaks
   removed. This is useful for including short snippets of text within a paragraph.

   Example:
   If quote.txt contains "to be or not to be\nthat is the question", the result will be:

   This paragraph includes to be or not to be that is the question right in the middle of the text.
